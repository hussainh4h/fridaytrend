== Description ==

The best WordPress Coupon theme for Affiliate Marketers. We built this theme after 6 years of experience with running a coupon and deal website. Hence we have added all important features that really matter, and left out all the useless features that would have only made it complicated.

It has a Widgetized sidebar and footer area, and it is WooCommerce ready, Compatible with Contact Form 7, Compatible with Visual Composer, Compatible with Elementor Page Builder.

This theme will be an active project which we will update from time to time. Check this page regularly for the updates. Your feedback on how we can continuously improve this Theme will be highly appreciated.
