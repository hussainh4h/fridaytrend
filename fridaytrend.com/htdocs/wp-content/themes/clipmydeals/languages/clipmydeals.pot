#. Description of the theme
msgid "The best WordPress Coupon theme for Affiliate Marketers. We built this theme after 6 years of experience with running a coupon and deal website. Hence we have added all important features that really matter, and left out all the useless features that would have only made it complicated. It is based on the most powerful frameworks in the world: \"_s\" (by Automattic, the main people behind WordPress development), Twitter Bootstrap (the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web) and Font Awesome (or Fontawesome, a full suite of 675+ pictographic icons for easy scalable vector graphics on websites). It has a Widgetized sidebar and footer area, and it is WooCommerce ready, Compatible with Contact Form 7, Compatible with Visual Composer, Compatible with Elementor Page Builder. This theme will be an active project which we will update from time to time. Check this page regularly for the updates. Your feedback on how we can continuously improve this Theme will be highly appreciated."
